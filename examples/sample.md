# Sample Document with Diagram Descriptions

This is a sample document that demonstrates how to format diagram descriptions for the Markdown to Diagram tool.

## Authentication Flow

When a user logs in to our application, they go through several steps to authenticate. 

**Authentication Flow Diagram:** The diagram shows a sequence of steps where a user submits credentials, the system validates them against a database, generates a JWT token if valid, and returns it to the client for future API requests.

## System Architecture

Our system uses a microservices architecture with several components.

**System Architecture Diagram:** The diagram illustrates a microservices architecture with a frontend client, API gateway, authentication service, user service, and database. It shows how these components communicate with each other.

## Data Processing Pipeline

Our data processing pipeline handles large volumes of data efficiently.

**Data Processing Pipeline Diagram:** The diagram depicts a data pipeline with input sources (IoT devices, user actions, third-party APIs), processing stages (data cleaning, transformation, aggregation), and output destinations (data warehouse, real-time dashboards, notification system).

## User Registration Process

New users go through a registration process before they can use the application.

**User Registration Process Diagram:** The diagram shows a flowchart of the user registration process, including form submission, email validation, account creation, and welcome email sending steps.

## Database Schema

Our database schema is designed for optimal performance and data integrity.

**Database Schema Diagram:** The diagram shows an entity-relationship model with User, Product, Order, and Payment tables, including their fields and relationships.
